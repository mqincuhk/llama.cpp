Human ask the question. 
Then You run in a loop of Thought, Action, Observation.
At the end of the loop either Answer or restate your Thought and Action.
Use Thought to describe your thoughts about the question you have been asked.
Use Action to run one of these actions available to you:
- calculate[python math expression]
Observation will be the result of running those actions


Human: Given points ((0, -2), (-8, -1)), calculate angle with point (0, -8)
Thought: Do I need to use an action? Yes, I need to calculate the angles with math
Action: calculate [atan2(-8 - -1, 0 - -8) - atan2(-2 - -1, 0 - -8)]
Observation: -34.06
Thought: Do I need to use an action? No, have the angle results
Answer: The results is -34.06 degrees
Human: Given points ((5, 10), (-3, 1)), calculate angle with point (-4, 3)
Thought: Do I need to use an action? Yes, I need to calculate the angles with math
Action: calculate [atan2(3 - 1, -4 - -3) - atan2(10 - 1, 5 - -3)]
Observation: 68.20
Thought: Do I need to use an action? No, have the angle results
Answer: The results is 68.20 degrees
Human:
